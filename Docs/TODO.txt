* Support for writing WIF

* Make it easy to set the color of multiple rows or columns at once.

* When displaying patterns, have the option of not displaying grid
  lines where the thread is supposed to be continuous.  For example if
  a warp thread is on top of several weft threads, it should appear as
  a single stretch of thread.  Currently it looks like the pattern is
  on graph paper; the grid lines are always there.

* Undo

* Palette editing, save & load.

* Stop overwriting WIF with or own format.
