* Support reading WIF files

* Support for writing WIF

* Allow starting with an existing sample pattern instead of a blank
  pattern.  Once I have WIF read support, this can be done by
  including public domain patterns with the program which can be
  opened as starting patterns.  See here for an online archive of WIF files:

* Make it easy to set the color of multiple rows or columns at once.

* When displaying patterns, have the option of not displaying grid
  lines where the thread is supposed to be continuous.  For example if
  a warp thread is on top of several weft threads, it should appear as
  a single stretch of thread.  Currently it looks like the pattern is
  on graph paper; the grid lines are always there.
